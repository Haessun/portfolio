In digital music production, selecting the right virtual instruments can be time-consuming. We propose a method using convolutional neural networks to retrieve desired musical instruments from reference audio. The new dataset, Nlakh, enhances training and evaluation. Our method successfully retrieves instruments from complex audio mixtures.

## Single-Instrument Encoder
Trained to identify instruments in single-track audio, creating unique embeddings for each instrument.

## Multi-Instrument Encoder
Uses embeddings from the Single-Instrument Encoder to detect multiple instruments in a mix.
